# Python Notebooks: OOP, Functions, Design Patterns, and Pydantic Examples

Welcome to the Python Notebooks repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that provide practical examples and exercises related to various key Python programming concepts. The notebooks cover the following topics:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Advanced Function Techniques**
- **Design Patterns**
- **Pydantic**

## Repository Contents

This repository is organized into Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of Python programming. Below is an overview of the contents:

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Concepts Covered**: Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism.
- **Examples**: Class design, method overriding, class relationships.

### Advanced Function Techniques

- **Concepts Covered**: Function decorators, function generators, function composition.
- **Examples**: Using `functools.partial`, creating custom decorators, function chaining.

### Design Patterns

- **Concepts Covered**: Singleton, Builder, Factory, Abstract Factory, Dependency Injection.
- **Examples**: Implementations of common design patterns to solve typical software design problems.

### Pydantic

- **Concepts Covered**: Data validation, settings management, type annotations.
- **Examples**: Creating and validating data models using Pydantic, using Pydantic for configuration management.

## Getting Started
