## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming is a fundamental programming paradigm used to structure and organize code. In this repository, we utilize OOP to model complex systems and processes, such as stock market simulations and industrial automation. Classes and objects are used to encapsulate data and functionality, making the code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
